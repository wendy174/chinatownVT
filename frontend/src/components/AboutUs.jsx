                    Welcome to Chinatown, a cornerstone of the Barre, VT community since 1992. For over 30 years, our family has been dedicated to serving authentic, high-quality Chinese cuisine with warmth and care. As a family-owned and operated business, we take great pride in sharing the flavors of our heritage with our neighbors and friends.

                    What began as a small dream has grown into a cherished part of the community, built on the principles of hard work, tradition, and a passion for great food. Over the years, we’ve watched our four children grow up alongside the restaurant, each of them attending college while always staying connected to the heart of our family – Chinatown.
